# 🌌 Phase-Bifurcation Cosmogenesis  
### *A CPT-symmetric, non-singular model of twin-universe formation*

This repository contains the **complete, fully reproducible implementation** of the *Phase-Bifurcation Cosmogenesis* framework — a CPT-symmetric, non-singular scenario in which the Universe emerges from a coherent, phase-compressed quantum state rather than from a classical singularity.

The model describes the evolution of a bounded phase variable Δϕ across ~9.2 e-folds, revealing a **critical transition point** (mϕ,crit ≈ 1.965) and three asymptotic regimes:

- **A — Synchronization** (Δϕ → 0)  
- **B — Antipodal locking** (Δϕ → π)  
- **C — Non-relaxation / escape** within a finite cosmological window  

All simulations, figures, datasets, and scripts used in the academic paper are provided here.
